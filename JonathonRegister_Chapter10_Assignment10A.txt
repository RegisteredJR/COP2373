This program completes the class definition of Money so that addition, multiplication, and subtraction are all supported. Then we create a test function to make sure all the operations from the Money class work. 

variables:
amount
currency

functions:
test_money_operations()

1. creates Money class
2. initialize Money object with specified amount and currency
3. implement addition/subtraction and multiplication for the Money objects
4. __str__ returns a string representation of the Money object
5. test_money_operations() tests the operations of the Money class
6. performs addition, subtraction and multiplication
7. verifies that operations on different currencies raise the appropriate exceptions
8. prints results
