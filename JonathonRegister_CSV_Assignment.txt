This program allows the user (instructor) to input how many students they want to enter and then enter the student names and also input their 3 exam grades. The program then uses the csv module to write each record into the grades.csv file including the headers. The second part of this is another program that then reads the grades.csv file and displays the data in tabular format using the with keyword.

variables:
first_name
last_name
exam1
exam2
exam3

functions:
write_grades_to_csv()
read_grades_from_csv()


1. The program collects input for the number of students and gathers each student's first name, last name, and three exam grades.

2. Data is written using the csv.writer module, ensuring that each record (student's data) 
is written as a row in the CSV file.

3. The program reads the grades.csv file using csv.reader.

4. Each subsequent row (each representing a student's data) is formatted and displayed in a tabular format.

5. The with statement is used to ensure proper file closing and resource management.
