This program creates a list of 30 commonly found words from spam messages, emails, phone calls, etc. and prompts the user to enter an email message. The program will then scan the message from the user for the 30 words or phrases and for every match, the program will add one point to the user's "spam score". It will then rate the likelihood that the message is spam based on the number of points received and will display the user's sopan score, the likelihood and the words/phrases that caused it to be spam.
